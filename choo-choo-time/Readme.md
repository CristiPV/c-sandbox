# C-sandbox

This repo contains various C snippet, a lot of which are meant for an Arduino (also refereed to as choo choo since I have a model train I control with said arduino)

## Running the code

To run the choo choo code you can use either Arduino IDE, or Visual Studio Code with the Arduino extension

To run the choo-choo project, open the [main](./main) directory and upload the [main.ino](./main/main.ino) file

#### IR stuff

To use the IR receiver, you need to install a library
